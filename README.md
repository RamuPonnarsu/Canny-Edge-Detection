Canny edge detection is a popular image processing technique used to identify edges within an image. Developed by John Canny in 1986, this algorithm enhances edges while reducing noise by employing a multi-stage process. Firstly, the image is smoothed using a Gaussian filter to reduce high-frequency noise. Next, gradient intensity and direction are calculated using convolution with Sobel operators. Non-maximum suppression is applied to thin out the edges, retaining only the pixels with the maximum gradient in a local neighborhood. Finally, hysteresis thresholding is used to determine which edges to include based on high and low intensity thresholds. The Canny edge detection algorithm is widely used in computer vision applications such as object recognition, image segmentation, and robotics, providing a robust method for highlighting significant features and boundaries in digital images.
